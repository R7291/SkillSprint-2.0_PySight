This Python script leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy to create an interactive virtual drawing canvas controlled by hand gestures captured through a webcam. Users can draw in various colors by selecting corresponding on-screen areas with hand movements. The script detects hand landmarks, interprets gestures, and responds to actions such as changing colors or clearing the canvas. Real-time drawing is displayed on the screen, offering an engaging and hands-free drawing experience. This project serves as a creative and intuitive interface for virtual art creation.
